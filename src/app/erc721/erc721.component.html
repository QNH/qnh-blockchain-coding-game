<h1>ERC721 tokens</h1>
<p>
  In this exercise we will be looking into getting into coding some of the smart contract and the communication with it
  as well. For this, you need a basic understanding of Typescript or at least Javascript. If not, it might be wise to
  look if you can team up with someone, but it shouldn't be that hard.
</p>
<p>
  As a reminder, applications can communicate with contracts in three ways: getting data is done using calls, altering
  data is done using transactions and waiting for changes is done using events.
</p>
<h2>
  Use case: trading plots
</h2>
<p>
  In this case, you may assume Ether as valid currency. A customer wants to research the opportunities to own plots in
  a smart contract and has found that the ERC-standard 721 is perfect for this. It allows the ownership of a unique
  token, rather than a balance of tokens as seen in ERC20, indentified by a unique integer. They provide you with the
  <span class="code">ERC721.sol</span> file in the contracts folder. There are some things that the client wants to
  change to meet the following requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>every user on the contract should have an Ether balance, allowing people to buy plots that are for sale;</li>
  <li>the contract should have zero predefined plots, but instead, the contract owner should be able to create plots on
    the go;</li>
  <li>when a plot is created, the plot should go up for sale immediately at a price given on creation;</li>
  <li>when a plot gets up for sale (or the price changes), a PlotForSale event should trigger with the identifier and
    the new price of the plot.</li>
</ul>
<div *ngIf="!hasErc721Contract">
  <p>
    Edit to contract to match these requirements. The headers of the functions are already there and may not change.
    You can deploy a new ERC721 contract using the button below. The button will paste your clipboard in the browser
    and deploy the contents of your clipboard. This will result in an address. This page will consider any contract as
    an ERC721 contract.
  </p>
</div>
<div *ngIf="hasErc721Contract()">
  <p>
    After editing the contract so it meets the requirements and deploying it, you have to create the communication
    between this
    application and the contract. This is done is the Erc721Service found in <span class="code">/src/services/erc721.service.ts</span>.
    The method headers have already been estabilished. If it turns out your made a mistake in your contract and you
    want to make a change, you have to recompile and redeploy the entire contract, meaning you'll get a new address. At
    the bottom of the page, you will always be able to deploy a contract again, as long as you have the binary code on
    your clipboard.
  </p>
  <div *ngIf="!hasCreatedErc721Token()">
    <p>
      For a start, make sure you are able to create an ERC721 token.
    </p>
    <p><span class="bonus">BONUS! </span> Make it so that the name and symbol parts of the form are used. The site can
      already process them - if done right.</p>
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="hasCreatedErc721Token() && !hasPurchasedErc721Token()">
    <p>
      Now that your ERC721 contract has a token, you can try to purchase it, or let anyone around you purchase it.

    work with your developed smart contract.
